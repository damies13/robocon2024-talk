Description:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- what it is and why it's important different to other performance testing tools
In this part of the talk I'll tell about the tool, what its for, what I believe the benefits are, why people might use RFSwarm over other performance test tools, and the problems I believe RFSwarm solves for people.

- why I created it
In this section I'll give a little bit about my background, ways I'd attempted to solve these problems before RFSwarm, and why I ended up creating RFSwarm.

- where it's at now
In this section I'll give an overview of where RFSwarm is today

- future plans
In this section I'll talk about the planned features and give a rough idea of the roadmap, things that I foresee that could change the roadmap.

- Q&A
In this section I'll open for people to ask any questions they want about RFSwarm and do my best to answer them.

Notes:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As the creator and only developer of RFSwarm, I would be the best person to give a talk on this subject.

Technical requirements:
As this will be a talk, a screen for power point presentations might be useful, I can bring my own laptop so a HDMI cable to plug into the screen projector would be sufficient.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lessons Learned:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Difficulties for an automation team doing test automation with one tool/language and then having to use another completely different tool & language for performance testing, how this becomes easier with RFSwarm.
- Learn that with RFSwarm they can use Robot Framework for performance testing as well
- Benifits to the Test team when all the test automation disciplines are all using the same scripting language

I expect to spend 5 min on each of the 5 sections I previously mentioned to bring the talk to 25 min.
